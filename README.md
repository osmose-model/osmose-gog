# osmose-gog
Gulf of Gabes configuration 

The osmose-gog model aims to capture the main processes that influence species life cycle and simulate the functioning of the Gulf of Gabes ecosystem (Southern Tunisia) according to opportunistic predation process based on size selection and spatio-temporal co-occurrence between a predator and its prey. Eleven high trophic level fish and invertebrate species are modelled in osmose-gog; seven bony fish (i.e. *Trachurus trachurus*, *Sardina pilchardus*, *Sardinella aurita*, *Engraulis encrasicolus*, *Diplodus annularis*, *Merluccius merluccius*, *Pagellus erythrinus*), one cartilaginous fish (i.e. *Mustelus mustelus*), one cephalopod (i.e. *Octopus vulgaris*) and two crustaceans (i.e. P*enaeus kerathurus*, *Metapenaeus monoceros*).

The osmose-gog model was calibrated with available data of biomass and fishing yield, using an optimization method based on evolutionary algorithms which is suitable for complex and stochastic models to characterize the structure of the food web in the 2000s. Then, the model was validated against independent data sets at different hierarchical levels: the individual (diet composition), population (mean size of commercial catch) and community levels (mean trophic level).

The whole set of parameters are extensively described in [Halouani et al. 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380016303118?via%3Dihub)
